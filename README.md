# FunkyFadz 

#### Funky Purpose

FunkyFadz is a .NET Framework and MVC CRUD app for educational purposes. I have built this app to gain knowledge and futher develop my C# and front end skills.

#### Main Funky Goal

I wanted to build a website that gathers together all the Funky Fadz from any given decade. Maybe it will spark some ideas after studying each decade of Funky Fadz.

#### How it Works

- Create an account and log in
- Browse through all the Funky Fadz that have been posted
- Phots of Fadz 
- If you're feeling Funky, add your own
- Edit and Delete any Funky Fad when logged in

#### Future Funky Plans

- Favorite Fad
- Filter by Decade
- Working search functionality


#### Postman Funky Captures 

- Captures of Token, Get, and Post.
